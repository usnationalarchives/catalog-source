# To override the packages the framework exports by default from the

# To append packages to the default set of exported system packages,
# set this value.

# The following property explicitly specifies the location of the bundle

# If this value is not absolute, then the felix.cache.rootdir controls

# location into an absolute one by specifying the root to prepend to
# the relative cache path. The default for this property is the
# current working directory.
#felix.cache.rootdir=${user.dir}

# The following property controls whether the bundle cache is flushed
# the first time the framework is initialized. Possible values are
