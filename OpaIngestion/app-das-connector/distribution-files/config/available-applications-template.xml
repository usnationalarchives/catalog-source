    <!--
		This file holds a list of available applications on the system that can be installed on Aspire server instances. 

		Notice that the list specified here works as a shortcut for the user when selecting which application to install in a server.
		This list won't restrict in any way the list of applications administrators can install, but to actually help them to select
		which ones to install from a known list.

		Also, note that an application can be a maven bundle (JAR file reachable using Maven coordinates) or simply and XML file (location
		specified as a file system path).

		To use this file, rename it to 'available-applications.xml' and place it under config folder of your distribution.	

		To add a new list entry, simply type a new <application> in the list below with the following format:

		<application name="Sample App" category="myCategory">
			<location> *** Maven coordinates to the JAR or a file system path to the application XML goes here *** </location>
			<description>This description will show on the user interface. Provide a summary of the application contents or function.</description>
		</application>
		
		Example of Maven bundle app:
		
		<application name="CIFS Connector" category="Connectors">
			<location>com.searchtechnologies.appbundles:app-cifs-connector</location>
			<description>Application bundle for CIFS connector. Crawls and process content from a CIFS share. Documents from this
			application bundle are ready to be submitted to a search engine</description>
		</application>
		
		Example of file system app:
		
		<application name="File uploader" category="Document Processing">
			<location>config/httpFeeder.xml</location>
			<description>Registers a servlet where third party applications can submit documents to Aspire.</description>
		</application>

		The "category" attribute allows you to classify your applications. You can create new categories on this file, by simple adding a different 
		value to the "category" attribute. On the user interface, the list of available categories is dynamically created from this
		list. Notice that category names are converted to lower case, and displayed with the first letter capitalized (for example "coNnEctors"
		changes to "Connectors").

		If no category is provided, your application will be added automatically to the "Other" category.
