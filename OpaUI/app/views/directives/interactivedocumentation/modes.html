      <div>This setting will not make changes to live Catalog data. Because responses are simulated, the data returned is for demonstration purposes only and there is only incomplete validity checking.</div>

      <div class="bold">Live</div>
      <div>This setting will return real responses from the Catalog system. Because responses are live, your API calls can make changes (e.g., add a tag) to Catalog data which will be attributed to your account.</div>
